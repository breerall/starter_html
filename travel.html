        <p>Still waiting for your Hogwarts Letter? So am I! But if you are as Potterheaded as I am, you want to have taken at least one of these trips before…well, before you can’t take it anymore! Trust me, I only jumped the train(or flight) to Michigan because of the Law Quad. (am I cool now?) Here are the Top 5 places you must visit to quench your thirst for everything Pottery!</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><h2>The Wizarding World of Harry Potter (Universal Studios)</h2>

            <li><h2>Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>
                <h3>Edinburgh, Scotland</h3>
                <p>J.K. Rowling wrote much of the Harry Potter series in Edinburgh, and fans can visit locations that inspired settings in the books, such as Edinburgh Castle (which inspired Hogwarts) and Victoria Street (the inspiration for Diagon Alley), as well as the cafes where Rowling wrote, including The Elephant House.</p>

            <li><h2>Alnwick Castle</h2>
                <h3>Alnwick, Northumberland, England</h3>
                <p>Alnwick Castle was a filming location for Hogwarts in the first two Harry Potter films. Fans can take a broomstick flying lesson in the very spot where Harry had his first flying lesson in "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."</p>

            <li><h2>Platform 9 ¾ at King’s Cross Station</h2>
                <h3>London, England</h3>
                <p>At King’s Cross Station, Platform 9 ¾ is where students catch the Hogwarts Express. Today, a sign and a trolley is disappearing into the wall, where fans can take photos and imagine they are off to Hogwarts. Nearby is the Harry Potter Shop, designed to resemble Ollivander's wand shop.</p>
