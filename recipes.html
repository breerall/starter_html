        <h1>Comfort Food from South India!</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>On a hard day, when I miss home, I crave something that brings home a tad bit closer to me. I can’t really hop on a 2k flight every time I miss home, so I turn to the kitchen instead and do my best to replicate my mom’s cooking. Indian food is characterized by its diverse and vibrant culinary traditions, varying significantly across the regions of India. In my completely biased opinion, South-Indian food takes a niche spot with its bold and intricate use of a wide array of spices and flavors and a generous use of local ingredients to create rich and flavorful dishes. South Indian comfort food offers a satisfying and soulful culinary experience. My top 5 go-to's are listed below:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Batter:

                        <li>Cover and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-10 hours or overnight until the batter rises and turns bubbly.</li>

                        <li>Stir the fermented batter well. If it is too thick, add a little water to achieve a pouring consistency.</li>
                        <li>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron dosa griddle on medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Lightly grease the griddle with oil using a piece of onion or a brush.</li>
                        <li>Pour a ladle of batter in the center of the griddle and quickly spread it out in a circular motion using the back of the ladle to form a thin pancake.</li>
                        <li>Drizzle a few drops of oil around the edges of the dosa.</li>
                        <li>Cook on medium heat until the bottom turns golden and crispy, and the top looks set.</li>

                        <li>(For masala dosa, place a generous amount of potato masala in the center of the dosa before folding it.)</li>
                        <li>Fold the dosa in half or roll it up and remove it from the griddle.</li>

                <li>Batter Consistency: The batter should be of pouring consistency but not too thin. It should coat the back of a spoon evenly.</li>
                <li>Cooking: Cook dosa on a medium-hot griddle to ensure even cooking and a crispy texture. The griddle should be hot enough that a few drops of water sizzle and evaporate quickly when sprinkled on it.</li>

                <li>Consistency: The pudding will thicken as it cools, so remove it from heat at a slightly thinner consistency than you desire.</li>
                <li>Cooking: Ensure to stir the mixture constantly while cooking to prevent it from sticking to the bottom and forming lumps.</li>
                <li>Serving: Annam Paramannam can be served either warm or cold. It tends to thicken further upon cooling, so you might need to adjust the consistency with a little milk before serving.</li>
                <li>Variations: You can add other flavorings like saffron or rose water for a different flavor profile.</li>
